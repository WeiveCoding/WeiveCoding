- My name's Josh, but most people call me Epsi.
- I primarily do game mods and small-scale softwares, but looking to expand into bigger things soon.
- I work mainly in JS, but gradually working on learning Python and C# as well.
- I enjoy collaborations (assuming people cooperate) but mostly work on my own.
