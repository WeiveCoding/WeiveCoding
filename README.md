- My name's Josh, but most people call me Epsi.
- I primarily do game mods and small-scale softwares, but looking to expand into bigger things soon.
- I work mainly in JS and C++, but gradually working on learning Python and C# as well.
- I primarily do my own work and contribute to open-source repositories.
